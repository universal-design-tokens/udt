# Design Token Parser Utilities

Low-level logic and utilities for parsing DTCG and DTCG-like files. Used by `@udt/dtcg-parser` to parse DTCG to TOM, but also suitable for building libraries or tools that parse DTCG(-like) token files to other representations, or need to traverse tokens and/or groups.
